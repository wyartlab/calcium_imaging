# calcium_imaging
This is where we store packages pertaining to calcium imaging.

Contents:

1) Andy's Manual ROI DFF Package v 11 (matlab): 
This is a package that uses FIJI to generate ROIs off an 8-bit .tiff, then calculates a bunch of parameters (including dF/F of course) from that .tiff

2) Jenna Sternberg's code for Sternberg et al Nature Comm 2018 (matlab)

3) Mathilde Lapoix's calcium imaging code (python)
